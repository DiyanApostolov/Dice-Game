If you want to play the game in your web browser [click here.](https://dicegame-project.netlify.app/)

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or
        the player decides to "hold":<br />
        ✔ If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next
        player's turn.<br />
        ✔ If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current
        score and the player's turn continues.<br />
        ✔ If a player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their
        total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.<br />
        The first player to score 100 or more points wins.<br />
