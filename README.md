Rules ðŸ§¾

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
âœ” If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

âœ” If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player's turn continues.

âœ” If a player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
